## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   `pip` package manager
*   A Google Gemini API Key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    *   Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project.
    *   Add your Gemini API key to this file:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

5.  **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    The application will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Open this URL in your browser to start using the app!

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

The application follows a simple but powerful architecture:

1.  **Frontend (UI):** The user adds job postings and resumes through the web interface.
2.  **Flask Backend:** The data is sent to the Flask server, which saves it to the local **SQLite** database.
3.  **Matching Request:** When a user clicks "Match Resume", the frontend sends the selected `job_id` and `resume_id` to the `/match` endpoint.
4.  **AI Analysis:** The Flask server retrieves the job and resume text from the database and sends them to the **Google Gemini API** with a carefully crafted prompt.
5.  **JSON Response:** The Gemini model analyzes the text and returns a structured JSON object containing the `match_score`, `strengths`, and `gaps`.
6.  **Display Results:** The backend forwards this JSON to the frontend, where the results are dynamically displayed to the user.

## API Endpoints

The application exposes the following RESTful API endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint      | Description                               |
|--------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `POST` | `/jobs`       | Adds a new job posting.                   |
| `GET`  | `/jobs`       | Retrieves a list of all job postings.     |
| `POST` | `/resumes`    | Adds a new resume.                        |
| `GET`  | `/resumes`    | Retrieves a list of all resumes.          |
| `POST` | `/match`      | Matches a job with a resume using the AI. |

## üìà Future Improvements

*   [ ] **File Uploads:** Allow users to upload PDF or DOCX resumes instead of copy-pasting text.
*   [ ] **Batch Matching:** Implement functionality to match one resume against multiple jobs at once.
*   [ ] **Database Migration:** Upgrade from SQLite to a more robust database like PostgreSQL for production use.
*   [ ] **Enhanced UI:** Add pagination and search functionality for jobs and resumes.
